                <vue-markdown>Name's Patrick. You can call me... Patrick. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I have 11 years of professional tech-industry experience spanning the following roles:

- UI/UX Designer
- Full-Stack Developer (main stack is NuxtJS, VueJS, Lumen, MySQL, NetlifyCMS, TailwindCSS)
- Machine Learning Engineer (primarily with semantic segmentation)
- Conversion Rate Optimizer (behavioural design + split tests)
- Copywriter (style bounces between irreverent and tear-jerking)
- Search Engine Optimizer (on-site only)

These skills are not rare. But they are rare in combination. This interdisciplinary capability - and more importantly, the knowledge and empathy from having all of these perspectives - is what makes me different from other coders. When we work together you get:

- An empathetic strategist who understands the "why" behind each task. 
- A purpose-driven and results-driven worker.
- Someone who looks for shortcuts (whether that's a framework, library, template, or different solution altogether) when appropriate, as speed and cost are two important factors in results-driven engineering.
- Someone who can manage and execute a web project in its entirety, without you needing to hire people with different specialties.
- A legitimate team-player who doesn't soak up the glory, doesn't defer the blame, and is otherwise generally not an asshole.
- A dude who laughs a lot, sees the good in people, and believes that **the good of all is for the good of all**.

Okay, tl;dr complete.

Have I yet swooned you? [Contact me](/#contact), please.

Not convinced? Cool. Many more words to follow.
