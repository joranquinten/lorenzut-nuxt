Usually I just rip stuff from [Sketch Repo](https://sketchrepo.com/) and then mold it to my needs using, as you might imagine, [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/). But sometimes I design stuff from scratch. Whatever works.\n\nAnd as for UX: back during my DealCatcher days I read literally every single [Nielsen Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com/) blog post. So consider me qualified ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\nCurrent projects of mine (that I designed and developed) are [Remote Faces](https://remotefaces.com), [Radically Marginal](https://radicallymarginal.com), and [Practicar](https://practicar.mx).\n\nAdditionally, here are some screenshots from websites I‚Äôve made over the years. All but one is - or was at one point - an actual live website‚Ä¶. not just a mockup.\n\n![](img/designs/showuply-4-browser.jpg)\n\n![](img/designs/showuply-2-browser.png)\n\n![](img/designs/showuply-browser.png)\n\n[I‚Äôve been an all-or-nothing person most of my life. It‚Äôs mostly gone away in the past couple of years, as I‚Äôve figured out who I am and what I want (not an easy task). But prior to that, I would make grand plans and have trouble following through. So I made this community to help people like me (there are a bunch of us) not quit when things got boring, or when we were feeling like imposters, or whatevs.](/img/designs/showuply.JPG)\n\n![](img/designs/feedhero-browser.png)\n\n[I made this pretty sophisticated Twitter Relationship Manager tool to seriously encourage authentic Twitter relationships. And I got about 35 people to pay for it and use it. But over time, I (and many of my users) started to realize that the best way to have authentic relationships was actually to skip Twitter altogether.](/img/designs/feedhero.png)\n\n![](img/designs/safecars-browser.png)\n\n[My (now ex) wife got in a bad car accident, and when she went to get a new car we couldn‚Äôt find a single service that let you search for used cars by safety AND price at the same time. So I compiled the data from a few different sources and made the site myself.

Because I really love their product but could never get past the 1990s web design. This is the only of these design screenshots that was snapped from Sketch‚Ä¶ all the rest were taken from live websites (though most on my local server).](/img/designs/beeminder.jpg)"

And then either [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) - or [Lumen](https://lumen.laravel.com/) + MySQL - for the backend, depending on the project.\n\nI made [this 4.7-star iOS App](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dealcatcher-coupons-deals-shopping-app/id534634276), [this Rails site](https://www.dealcatcher.com/), [this custom-MVC site](https://www.pickmonitor.com/), [this Vue site](https://luxonis.com/), and too many [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) sites to count.\n\nI‚Äôve worked with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/), [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/), and [Shopify](https://shopify.com). I‚Äôve installed beautiful [Flarum](https://flarum.org) forums like [this one](https://discuss.luxonis.com). I, of course, speak the much-hated [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) (but haven‚Äôt used it in some time). I‚Äôve done brief C and C++ firmware development.\n\nI use postman, composer, and npm, and scss, and probably whatever else you use.\n\nDo I have X years of experience with Y specific framework? I don‚Äôt know. Probably not. But if you‚Äôre judging a candidate based on whether they have experience with Vue versus whether they have experience with React‚Ä¶ I not-so-humbly think you‚Äôre doing it wrong.\n\n[Oh, and also, I do things the right way, for the right reasons. My code is clean AF, and the things I make are crisp AF. As just one silly example, here‚Äôs the Page Speed for this site on my very first check, before a single optimization.

In fact, I don't even *like* coding. I find it horribly boring, lonely, and a little bit depressing.\n\nNor am I a designer or a marketer.\n\nI'm a problem-solving human being who happens to know how to code, how to design, and how to market.\n\nTo the right business, this distinction will make all the difference. Because whether I speak React or Vue or Angular is missing the point. It's meaningless fluff.\n\nPut a problem on my desk and I'll figure it out.\n\nThat said, here's a rundown of the various roles that I've held in my 12 years of professional experience.",
  "outro": "Why so many different roles? Because I've only ever worked at tiny companies. Tiny companies don't have the luxury of specificity, so my teams were often asked \"would anybody be willing to take a shot at X?\" I was - and will continue to be - the first person to raise his hand."
