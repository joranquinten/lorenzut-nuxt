Is that so much to ask?\n\nBack before I went full Tyler Durden on my life in 2016 I was making $140k per year.\n\nDespite socialist leanings, I don't believe that the acquisition of small-scale wealth is inherently evil. And for this reason, all else equal, $140k per year is the minimum I want to be compensated going forward for full-time work.\n\nThat said, all else is never equal. I will always prioritize health and meaning over income. So if you're doing something you think I'd like - regardless of your budget - I'd love to talk.\n\nFor contract work, I charge $125/hr, with discounts for projects spanning one month or longer."

And frankly, I find it a little suspicious that most won't.\n\nGiven that Iâ€™m a risk-tolerant guy with ultra low expenses and zero dependents... there are only three reasons why I wouldn't accept equity.\n\n1. I don't believe in your project's mission.\n2. I don't believe in your project's ability to make money.\n3. I don't believe in you or your team.\n\nIn all three of those cases... I should say no to your project. Right?\n\nSo, yeah, I'm happy to put ~~my~~ your money where my mouth is. I need to be paid a minimum of **$2,500/month** in order to live comfortably, but am happy to accept some or all of the remaining payment in the form of equity."
