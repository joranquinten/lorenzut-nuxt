And frankly, I find it a little telling that most freelancers and consultants *won't* work for equity.\n\nGiven that Iâ€™m a risk-tolerant guy with ultra low expenses and zero dependents... there are only three reasons why I wouldn't accept equity.\n\n1. I don't believe in your project's mission.\n2. I don't believe in your project's ability to make money.\n3. I don't believe in you or your team.\n\nIn all three of those cases...

I need to be paid a minimum of $2,500/month in cash to pay my bills (plus a little buffer), but am happy to accept some or all of the remaining payment in the form of equity."
