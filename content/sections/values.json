  "intro": "I value ridiculous laughs, tomfoolery, ballyhoo, attempting to frown while skipping, existential crises, type 2 fun, eco-friendly glitter, naked bike rides, ultimate frisbee, almond butter, expertly-roasted ‘mallows, bunny ears, funkadelic tunes, shower thoughts, and stories of romance.\n\nPity for my bank account I also value human rights, equity, inclusivity, the environment, future generations, human connection, physical health, mental health, and minimalism.\n\nAnd perhaps most damning is what I don’t value. I don’t value tech advancements for the sake of tech advancements. And I don’t value tech advancements for the sake of monetary advancements.\n\nI understand that these views will annoy many people and disqualify me from most jobs - therefore causing me to 'earn' significantly less money than I otherwise would. And I'm good with that. I'm a filthy socialist Bernie supporter, after all :)\n\nHere are deeper dives into some values that may be important if we work together."
