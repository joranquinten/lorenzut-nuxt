    "intro": "If we're ONLY talking about money... For a full-time position, I expect to be compensated $150,000 per year (including the value of benefits). For a part-time position, $75 per hour. For freelance work, $125 per hour.",
    "outro": "These figures assume a halfway-interesting job for an ethical, but not hugely exciting project. The more deeply you speak to my <a href='/#values'>values and interests</a>, the more I'm happy to discount the above.\n\nMy annual expenses are less than $20,000, and I don't much care about money, so - for the right job - compensation won't be an issue."
