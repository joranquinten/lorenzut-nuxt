'Cuz I’m a risk-tolerant guy with ultra low expenses and zero dependents. So there are only three reasons why I wouldn't accept equity.\n\n1. I don't believe in your project's mission.\n2. I don't believe in your project's ability to make money.\n3. I don't believe in you or your team.\n\nIn all three of those cases... I should say no to your project. Right?\n\nSo, yeah, I'm happy to put ~~my~~ your money where my mouth is. I want to be paid a minimum of **$2,500/month** in order to live comfortably, but am happy to accept some or all of the remaining payment in the form of equity."
