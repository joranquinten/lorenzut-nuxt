    "content": "I value ridiculous laughs, tomfoolery, ballyhoo, attempting to frown while skipping, existential crises, type 2 fun, eco-friendly glitter, naked bike rides, ultimate frisbee, almond butter, expertly-roasted ‘mallows, bunny ears, funkadelic tunes, shower thoughts, and stories of romance.\n\nOr in short: I'm a happy-go-lucky ball of silliness.\n\nPity for my bank account I also value human rights, equity, inclusivity, the environment, future generations, human connection, minimalism, et al.\n\nBut lest I get ahead of myself, this about page isn’t really about career stuff.
